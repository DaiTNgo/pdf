Some of these include:\\nTechnological singularity\\nWhile this topic garners a lot of public attention, many researchers are not concerned\\nwith the idea of AI surpassing human intelligence in the near future. Technological\\nsingularity is also referred to as strong AI or superintelligence. Philosopher Nick Bostrum\\ndeﬁnes superintelligence as “any intellect that vastly outperforms the best human brains\\nin practically every ﬁeld, including scientiﬁc creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.”\\nDespite the fact that superintelligence is not imminent in society, the idea of it raises\\nsome interesting questions as we consider the use of autonomous systems, like self-\\ndriving cars. It’s unrealistic to think that a driverless car would never have an accident,\\nbut who is responsible and liable under those circumstances? Should we still develop\\nautonomous vehicles, or do we limit this technology to semi-autonomous vehicles which\\nhelp people drive safely? The jury is still out on this, but these are the types of ethical\\ndebates that are occurring as new, innovative AI technology develops.\\nAI impact on jobs\\nWhile a lot of public perception of artiﬁcial intelligence centers around job losses, this\\nconcern should probably be reframed. With every disruptive, new technology, we see\\nthat the market demand for speciﬁc job roles shifts. For example, when we look at the\\nautomotive industry, many manufacturers, like GM, are shifting to focus on electric\\nvehicle production to align with green initiatives. The energy industry isn’t going away,\\nbut the source of energy is shifting from a fuel economy to an electric one.\\nIn a similar way, artiﬁcial intelligence will shift the demand for jobs to other areas. There\\nwill need to be individuals to help manage AI systems. There will still need to be people\\nto address more complex problems within the industries that are most likely to be\\naffected by job demand shifts, such as customer service. The biggest challenge with\\nartiﬁcial intelligence and its effect on the job market will be helping people to transition\\nto new roles that are in demand.\\nPrivacy\\nPrivacy tends to be discussed in the context of data privacy, data protection, and data\\nsecurity. These concerns have allowed policymakers to make more strides in recent\\nyears. For example, in 2016, GDPR legislation was created to protect the personal data\\nof people in the European Union and European Economic Area, giving individuals more', metadata={'source': 'benchmarks_data_2\\\\What_is_Machine_Learning_IBM.pdf', 'page': 10}), Document(page_content='control of their data.

As a result, investments in security have become an\\nincreasing priority for businesses as they seek to eliminate any vulnerabilities and\\nopportunities for surveillance, hacking, and cyberattacks.\\nBias and discrimin ation\\nInstances of bias and discrimination across a number of machine learning systems have\\nraised many ethical questions regarding the use of artiﬁcial intelligence. How can we\\nsafeguard against bias and discrimination when the training data itself may be generated\\nby biased human processes? While companies typically have good intentions for their\\nautomation efforts,\\xa0Reuters\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) highlights some of the\\nunforeseen consequences of incorporating AI into hiring practices.

Some of these include:\\nTechnological singularity\\nWhile this topic garners a lot of public attention, many researchers are not concerned\\nwith the idea of AI surpassing human intelligence in the near future. Technological\\nsingularity is also referred to as strong AI or superintelligence. Philosopher Nick Bostrum\\ndeﬁnes superintelligence as “any intellect that vastly outperforms the best human brains\\nin practically every ﬁeld, including scientiﬁc creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.”\\nDespite the fact that superintelligence is not imminent in society, the idea of it raises\\nsome interesting questions as we consider the use of autonomous systems, like self-\\ndriving cars. It’s unrealistic to think that a driverless car would never have an accident,\\nbut who is responsible and liable under those circumstances? Should we still develop\\nautonomous vehicles, or do we limit this technology to semi-autonomous vehicles which\\nhelp people drive safely? The jury is still out on this, but these are the types of ethical\\ndebates that are occurring as new, innovative AI technology develops.\\nAI impact on jobs\\nWhile a lot of public perception of artiﬁcial intelligence centers around job losses, this\\nconcern should probably be reframed. With every disruptive, new technology, we see\\nthat the market demand for speciﬁc job roles shifts. For example, when we look at the\\nautomotive industry, many manufacturers, like GM, are shifting to focus on electric\\nvehicle production to align with green initiatives. The energy industry isn’t going away,\\nbut the source of energy is shifting from a fuel economy to an electric one.\\nIn a similar way, artiﬁcial intelligence will shift the demand for jobs to other areas. There\\nwill need to be individuals to help manage AI systems. There will still need to be people\\nto address more complex problems within the industries that are most likely to be\\naffected by job demand shifts, such as customer service. The biggest challenge with\\nartiﬁcial intelligence and its effect on the job market will be helping people to transition\\nto new roles that are in demand.\\nPrivacy\\nPrivacy tends to be discussed in the context of data privacy, data protection, and data\\nsecurity. These concerns have allowed policymakers to make more strides in recent\\nyears.

As a result, investments in security have become an\\nincreasing priority for businesses as they seek to eliminate any vulnerabilities and\\nopportunities for surveillance, hacking, and cyberattacks.\\nBias and discrimin ation\\nInstances of bias and discrimination across a number of machine learning systems have\\nraised many ethical questions regarding the use of artiﬁcial intelligence.
